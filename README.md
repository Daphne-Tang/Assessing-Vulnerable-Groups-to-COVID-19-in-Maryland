## Data Answer

[Maryland Confirmed COVID-19 Deaths By Age]

The graph demonstrates that confirmed deaths are higher for older individuals, and the gap has widened throughout the course of the pandemic. In November, the confirmed deaths for the 80+, 70-79, and 60-69 age groups were approximately 60,000, 30,000, and 20,000 respectively. In contrast, the younger age groups had confirmed deaths around or below 10,000. The data shows that older individuals are several times as likely to die from COVID-19. 

[Maryland Confirmed COVID-19 Deaths By Race]

The graph illustrates the presence of racial discrepancies. In November, Whites and African Americans had around 50,000 confirmed deaths. Hispanics, Asians, and Other Races had around 14,000, 5,000, and 1,000 respectively. 

[Maryland Confirmed COVID-19 Deaths By Gender]

The graph demonstrates that there are not major gender discrepancies in COVID-19 confirmed deaths. Males have slightly higher confirmed deaths than females, but the values are relatively similar.
