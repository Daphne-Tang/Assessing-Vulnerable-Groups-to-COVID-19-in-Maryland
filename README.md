# Assessing-Vulnerable-Groups-to-COVID-19-in-Maryland

## Background 
In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has spread across the United States.

## Business Question
* How should Maryland distribute resources to support the most vulnerable groups to COVID-19?

## Data Question
* What do confirmed COVID-19 deaths in Maryland look like for different age groups, races, and genders? 

## Data
This analysis used datasets from [Maryland Open Data](https://opendata.maryland.gov). The program provides transparency about state trends to facilitate decision and policy-making.

## Data Answer

Please refer to the Python analysis conducted in Google Colaboratory [here.](https://github.com/Daphne-Tang/Assessing-Vulnerable-Groups-to-COVID-19-in-Maryland/blob/main/Python_in_Google_Colaboratory.ipynb)

The graph demonstrates that confirmed deaths are higher for older individuals, and the gap has widened throughout the course of the pandemic. In November, the confirmed deaths for the 80+, 70-79, and 60-69 age groups were approximately 2,100, 1,100, and 700 respectively. In contrast, the younger age groups had confirmed deaths below 500. The data shows that older individuals are several times as likely to die from COVID-19.

The graph illustrates the presence of racial discrepancies. In November, Whites and African Americans had around 2,000 confirmed deaths. Hispanics, Asians, and Other Races had below 500.

The graph demonstrates that there are not major gender discrepancies in COVID-19 confirmed deaths. Males have slightly higher confirmed deaths than females, but the values are relatively similar. 

## Business Answer

With the COVID-19 pandemic escalating in severity, the distribution of resources, especially vaccines, to combat the virus is becoming increasingly important. State governments should protect the most vulnerable populations first in order to prevent more deaths and spread.
